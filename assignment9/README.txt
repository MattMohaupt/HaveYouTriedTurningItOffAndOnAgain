Have You Tried Turning It Off and On Again?

Matthew Mohaupt, Scott Hong, MaryJo Santos

How to play:

Controls:
		- W key to move forward
		- S key to move backwards
		- A key to strafe left
		- D key to strafe right
		- Mouse Movement for camera controls
		- E key to pick up a carriable object
		- F key to interact with interactable object


Game Instruction:
	To make as much money as possible before the timer is up. You need to fix the PCs, and it will give you $100 per pc fixed. Red PCs have hardware related issues so they need to be interacted with the wrench & screw, whereas the blue PCs have software related issues so they need to be interacted with the battery. Also, blackout occurs at regular intervals. During blackout, you can't fix any computers. So, you will have to interact with light generator to turn light on and keep resolving PC issues. 


Beta feedback and final retrospect:
Changes from Beta:
	-Increased timer from 100 seconds to 150 seconds
	-Made items despawn after use and respawn back in their original spots
	-Add penalty of -50 dollars for failing to fix a pc
	-Add light generator mechanic
		Need to turn lights on if lights turned off
		Added corresponding sound effects
		Added UI element to warn players of the imminent power loss
	-Changed pc models to be more ambiguous and less pre-production like
		Not just red and blue anymore
	-Added more spotlights to highlight key areas
	-Made UI stand out more with backgrounds


What you learned from your beta release and from your public release:
	-Visual queues and auditory cues are very important and need to have those in order to help guide the players to the correct goal
	-UI was very hard to see and it is not obvious when players were doing something wrong vs right as with not audio cues it is hard to understand
	-There needs to be a reason to explore the level if presented in one


What you are most proud of about your game:
	-Proud that it is a fully functional game and it has a reward, punishment, and a resolution
	-Like that the level design forces you to make fast decisions if you want to maximize your score
		can’t dilly dally


What changes you made to your original game design for technical reasons and why:
	-Having multiple levels and using the money made in order to buy other items
		Too little time to implement proper levels
	-There were supposed to be many items
		it was already confusing using the two items for most play testers so only stuck with the basic 2
	-More single player focused compared to the original game design
		All the testing in alpha and beta was done with only one tester and making a game that could only be enjoyed by having two people wasn’t fun for the single player tester


What changes you made to your original game design for playability reasons and why:
	-Added more obstacles to the level 
		Forced player to move around the map more rather than just staying in one place or only having to go in a straight line to the destination
		Kept it more interesting 


What did you learn from your playtesters:
	-Made observations about how easy it is to understand the game and complete its objective


What changes did you make to your game as a result of the playtesting?:
	-Made changes to make clear the player’s potential actions and also gave them more reasons to explore the map due to the feedback we received.


What you would do next if you had more time:
	-add more (harder) levels / increase difficulty
	-expand the map
	-add more tools
	-add multiple problems on the computers.
	-Add visual indicators of how long the timer for the NPC’s have left until they leave
	-Add subtle opaque text prompts to give a visual hint for the players


What you would do differently next time:
	-Different bug reporting tool
		Didn’t really utilize it too heavily
		Was very tedious to make bug reports
	-Log empirical data during play testing
		How long did it take for them to figure out the controls
		How long did they spend looking for objects
		How much money did they make in all their playthroughs
		We only we really recorded qualitative data but should have recorded more quantitative as well
	-Plan weeks better
		Plan each day of each week more efficiently to reduce the amount of crunch we had to do at the end
