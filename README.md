Game Instruction:
	To make as much money as possible before the timer is up. You need to fix the PCs, and it will give you $100 per pc fixed. Red PCs have hardware related issues so they need to be interacted with the wrench & screw, whereas the blue PCs have software related issues so they need to be interacted with the battery. Also, blackout occurs at regular intervals. During blackout, you can't fix any computers. So, you will have to interact with light generator to turn light on and keep resolving PC issues.
